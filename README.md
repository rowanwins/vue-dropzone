# vue-dropzone

A Vue component for file uploads, powered by [Dropzone.js](http://www.dropzonejs.com/). [Check out the demo](https://rowanwins.github.io/vue-dropzone/dist/index.html).

## Install
````
// For Vue.js 2.0+
npm install vue2-dropzone@^2.0.0
````
You'll also need to load either the [Material Icon](https://material.io/icons/) or [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icon kits depending on which style of icon you'd like.
````html
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
````

## Usage
1. Import the module (`import Dropzone from 'vue2-dropzone'`)
2. Register it as a component as you would any other Vue component
3. Use it within your template

### Example
````vue
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <p>Welcome to your Vue.js app!</p>

    <dropzone id="myVueDropzone" url="https://httpbin.org/post" v-on:vdropzone-success="showSuccess">
        <!-- Optional parameters if any! -->
        <input type="hidden" name="token" value="xxx">
    </dropzone>

  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import Dropzone from 'vue2-dropzone'

  export default {
    name: 'MainApp',
    components: {
      Dropzone
    },
    methods: {
      'showSuccess': function (file) {
        console.log('A file was successfully uploaded')
      }
    }
  }
</script>
````

## Props

## Custom Dropzone preview template

> NOTE : Props like `thumbnailWidth,thumbnailHeight, useFontAwesome` will not work when you override the dropzone preview. No worry you can refer [demo file](demo/custom-dropzone-preview.vue) to achieve same. :) Don't forgot to add your styles in `<style>`

## Methods
Methods you can call on the component.

| Method | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| setOption(optionname, value) | Sets the value of one of the dropzone options after initialisation. Handy if you need to pass through a token after the component has initialised. |
| removeAllFiles() | Empties the dropzone area.|
| processQueue() | Uploads the files, required if autoProcessQueue is set to false.|
| removeFile(file) | Removes a file from the dropzone area.|
| manuallyAddFile(file, fileUrl, callback, crossOrigin) | Manually adds a file to the dropzone area. See the [dropzone doco](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/wiki/FAQ#how-to-show-files-already-stored-on-server) for more information. |
| getAcceptedFiles() | Returns array of valid/ accepted files. |
| getRejectedFiles() | Returns array of Invalid/ rejected files. |
| getUploadingFiles() | Returns array of uploading files. |
| getQueuedFiles() | Returns array of uploading files. |


## Using Methods
Methods can be called from your parent component by making use of the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#ref">special tag "ref"</a>.

When you initialize the component add a unique ID to the dropzone element using the ref tag, like this

```html
<dropzone ref="myUniqueID"></dropzone>
```
Then from your parent Vue instance, you can call the methods by using the following:

```javascript
vm.$refs.myUniqueID.processQueue()
//vm refers to your current instance
```

## Events
Events emitted by the component to the parent.

| Event Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| vdropzone-file-added(file) | File added to the dropzone.|
| vdropzone-files-added(file) | Files added to the dropzone.|
| vdropzone-file-added-manually(file) | Manually added file to the dropzone |
| vdropzone-thumbnail(file, dataUrl) | When the thumbnail has been generated. Receives the dataUrl as second parameter. |
| vdropzone-success(file, response) | File successfully uploaded.|
| vdropzone-error(file, message, xhr) | An error occured. Receives the error `message` as second parameter and if the error was due to the XMLHttpRequest the xhr object as third. |
| vdropzone-error-multiple(files, message, xhr) | See `vdropzone-error` for description.|
| vdropzone-removed-file(file, error, xhr) | A file was removed from the dropzone.|
| vdropzone-sending(file, xhr, formData) | Modify the request and add addtional parameters to request before sending.|
| vdropzone-success-multiple(files, response) | Fired if the uploadMultiple option is true.|
| vdropzone-sending-multiple(files, xhr, formData) | Fired if the uploadMultiple option is true.|
| vdropzone-queue-complete(file, xhr, formData) | Fired when queue has been completely processed/ uploaded.|
| vdropzone-processing(file) | When a file gets processed (since there is a queue not all files are processed immediately). This event was called processingfile previously.|
| vdropzone-processing-multiple(files) | See `vdropzone-processing` for description.|
| vdropzone-upload-progress(file, progress, bytesSent) | Gets called periodically whenever the file upload progress changes.<br />Gets the `progress` parameter as second parameter which is a percentage (0-100) and the `bytesSent` parameter as third which is the number of the bytes that have been sent to the server.<br />When an upload finishes dropzone ensures that uploadprogress will be called with a percentage of 100 at least once.<br /><br />**Warning:** This function can potentially be called with the same progress multiple times. 
| vdropzone-total-upload-progress(totaluploadprogress, totalBytes, totalBytesSent) | This event can be used to show the overall upload progress of all files. Note : `totaluploadprogress (0-100)`|
| vdropzone-mounted() | Fired when dropzone component is mounted. |
| duplicate-file(file) | Fired when duplicateCheck is enabled. |
| vdropzone-drop(event) | The user dropped something onto the dropzone |
| vdropzone-drag-start(event) | The user started to drag anywhere |
| vdropzone-drag-end(event) | Dragging has ended |
| vdropzone-drag-enter(event) | The user dragged a file onto the Dropzone |
| vdropzone-drag-over(event) | The user is dragging a file over the Dropzone |
| vdropzone-drag-leave(event) | The user dragged a file out of the Dropzone |


## Listening to other Dropzone events
If you've referenced your tag with a ref property/tag as described in 'Using Methods', you can then access the Dropzone instance as well. This is useful if, for example, you want to add event listeners that have not been pre-configured (see below)
From your parent Vue instance:
```javascript
mounted () {
  this.$refs.dropzone.dropzone.on('addedfile', function (file) {
    if (this.files.length > 1) {
      this.removeFile(this.files[0])
    }
  })
  this.$refs.dropzone.dropzone.on('maxfilesexceeded', function (file) {
    this.removeFile(file)
  })
}
```

## Integration with Laravel Framework
In order to use vue-dropzone with laravel, you need to add the csrf-token to the component. Note that you need 2 things for it to work with Laravel:

1. A hidden input with name="csrf-token" and :value that can be set in data() of your component.

2. Additionally, you need to set :headers attribute for dropzone component where you pass a csrfHeader object created under the data() function in your vue component. See below for example:
 
```html
<template>
    <div>
        <dropzone id="myVueDropzone"
                  url="/post"
                  v-on:vdropzone-success="showSuccess"
                  :headers="csrfHeader">
        <!-- csrf token for laravel -->
        <input type="hidden" name="csrf-token" :value="csrfToken">
        </dropzone>
    </div>
</template>
```
 
```html

<script>
export default {
    data() {
        return {
            csrfToken: document.head.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').content,
            csrfHeader: {
                'X-CSRF-TOKEN': document.head.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').content
            }
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Development

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve example at localhost:8080
